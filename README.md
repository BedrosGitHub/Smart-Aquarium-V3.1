## Installation

To get started with Smart Aquarium V3.1, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BedrosGitHub/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1.git
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   You will need the following libraries to compile the project:
   - ESP8266WiFi
   - AsyncWebServer
   - LittleFS
   - NTPClient
   - ArduinoJson

   You can install these libraries through the Arduino Library Manager.

3. **Upload the Code**:
   Open the project in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your ESP8266.

4. **Configure Wi-Fi**:
   Edit the `config.h` file to enter your Wi-Fi credentials.

5. **Compile and Upload**:
   After configuring, compile and upload the code to your ESP8266.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can access the web interface by entering the IP address of your ESP8266 in your web browser. The default IP address is usually `192.168.1.1`, but it may vary depending on your network configuration.

## Control Modes

Smart Aquarium V3.1 offers four control modes to suit your needs:

1. **Manual Mode**: Control the relays directly from the web interface.
2. **Scheduled Mode**: Set specific times for the relays to turn on or off.
3. **Timer Mode**: Use a timer to control the relays for a set duration.
4. **Toggle Mode**: Switch the relays on and off at regular intervals.

## Web UI

The web UI is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. You can easily navigate through different sections to manage your aquarium settings. The interface displays the current status of each relay, along with options to change settings.

## API Documentation

Smart Aquarium V3.1 provides a RESTful API for remote control. Below are some of the key endpoints:

- **GET /status**: Retrieve the current status of the aquarium.
- **POST /control**: Send commands to control the relays.
- **GET /settings**: Fetch current settings.
- **POST /settings**: Update settings.

Refer to the API documentation in the repository for more details on each endpoint.

## OTA Updates

Over-the-air (OTA) updates allow you to update the firmware without needing to connect your ESP8266 to a computer. To perform an OTA update:

1. Ensure your ESP8266 is connected to the internet.
2. Upload the new firmware version using the web interface.

You can download the latest releases from the [Releases section](https://github.com/BedrosGitHub/Smart-Aquarium-V3.1/releases).

## Time Synchronization

Smart Aquarium V3.1 uses the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to keep the time synchronized. This feature is essential for scheduled operations and ensures that your aquarium operates on a consistent schedule.

## Persistent Settings Storage

The settings are stored in LittleFS, allowing you to retain your configurations even after a power outage. This feature ensures that your aquarium operates according to your preferences without needing to reconfigure every time.
